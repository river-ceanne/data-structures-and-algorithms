## Reverse an Array

### Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

### Approach & Efficiency
My apporach was to loop through the array half its length and exchange the values on opposite ends of the array. It has a time-complexity of O(n).
